    A quick project overview.

    Provide a short description of the project's goals and a bit of background. Any links that you frequently access are also good to include up at the top as well, for easy access. Everyone loves easy access.

    Information about the directory structure.

    Typically we have more than just Drupal in our repository root, so it's helpful to have a brief description of what is in there. We typically have a drush folder for aliases and commands, as well as a patches directory with its own README.

    How to get started developing.

    Tell the developers what the best way to jump into the project might be. Things like, "clone this repository, create a feature branch, run the installer, download a copy of the database, etc.. Whomever reviews the pull request should also do things like remove the remote branch from the repository once it is merged."

    Code promotion workflow.

    It's a good idea to outline your development process, as it may change from project to project. Do you want people to fork your repository and send pull requests; create feature branches and send pull requests; or just go ahead and commit to master? Let the developers know up-front, so there's no confusion.

    Environments.

    Outline information for your dev, staging and live environments, if you have them. Also, outline the process for getting things to the various places. How do I make sure my code is on staging? What is the best way to grab a database dump? We like to setup drush aliases for each environment ahead of time as a means of outlining this information and giving developers a good starting point. This document contains some example commands for doing some typical operations. Here's an example.

    Links to where to find more information.

    Typically this is our wiki, where we keep more detailed documentation and notes on things; project details like the original proposal's SOW, credentials to environments, Scrum Notes, Pre-launch checklists, etc.
